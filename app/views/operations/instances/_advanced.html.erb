  OneOps keeps track of all deployed component instances in the cloud. If you run into a situation where the
  instance was removed from the cloud outside of OneOps or if you want to remove the reference for this instance
  from OneOps for any other reason you can use the button below.
  Note that removing the component instance from the OneOps operations view will make your environment manifest in
  transition out of sync and OneOps will try to recreate this instance on the next deployment. Conversly if you are
  trying to delete this instance and it doesn't exist in the cloud anymore, removing the instance reference will
  result in the transition deployment not attempting to delete the instance anymore.<br><br>
